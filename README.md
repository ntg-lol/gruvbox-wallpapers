# gruvbox-wallpapers

a collection of gruvbox wallpapers by me

# jpg wallpapers

these wallpapers are in jpg format because it seems to be the most accepted wallpaper format. if you want something else, just use an online converter.

# svg wallpapers

these wallpapers were created in inkscape, then converted to jpg format with [this converter](https://svgconverter.com/svg-to-jpg/).

in the svg folder are the svg versions of each of the wallpapers for, you know, making the design process visible.
